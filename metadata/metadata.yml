description: |-
  Solving the linear system of equations with nonsymmetric, dense, and typically ill-conditioned
  matrices can be viewed as a key subject in BEM. Applying direct methods like Gauss elimination,
  Gauss-Jordan, LU decomposition, and so on, will be computationally expensive for the
  large scale system of equations and a rule of thumb shows that iterative methods become more
  efficient. In the present code, some Krylov subspace methods as biconjugate
  gradient (BiCG), conjugate gradient squared (CGS) and bi-conjugate gradient stabilized
  (BiCGSTAB) have been used to solve the dense system of equations arisen from BEM for solving the Laplace equation.
